What?
====================
This is the Custom Logger developed for Lamar Advertising to take all the keys and values filled out in this component to JSON to feed to AWS SQS queue and then to elastic.


Why?
====================
We need JSON logger messages to feed into ELK in-order to reconciliate the data easily.


How?
==========================
Just install this module from exchange onto the mule palette and use this as required.
